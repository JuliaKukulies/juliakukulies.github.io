## Interaction of meso-scale and large-scale processes 

I am interested in how large-scale processes such as monsoon-driven water vapor transport affects
meso-scale processes like the organization of convection into large storm complexes. 
I am particularly interested in the dynamics of mesoscale convective systems around major 
mountain regions and how large topographic barriers such as the Rockys, the Andes or the 
Himalayas interact with the atmospheric flow. 


## Convection-permitting climate simulations 

To understand how these processes are affected by anthropogenically forced climate change, I am working with 
convection-permitting climate simulations. Our lab is coordinating the [CORDEX Flagship Pilot Study](https://cordex.org/experiment-guidelines/flagship-pilot-studies/) [Convection-Permitting Third Pole](http://rcg.gvc.gu.se/cordex_fps_cptp/) that aims to assess
the benefits and limitations of convection-permitting simulations in the Tibetan Plateau region. 


## Development of data analysis tools 

Dealing with huge amounts of data from climate model output to satellite observations and an even larger number of different
data formats, I have developed a huge appreciation and interest for open source software tools. I am in the developer 
group of a community-developed python package for cloud tracking in large datasets called [**tobac**: Tracking and Object-based Analysis of Clouds](https://github.com/tobac-project/tobac) and I am motivated to become more active in the community!
