I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="http://rcg.gvc.gu.se/">Regional Climate Group</a> at the
<a href="https://www.gu.se/en/earth-sciences">Department for Earth Sciences</a>,<a href="https://www.gu.se/en">University of Gothenburg</a>
My PhD project is about past and future changes in the atmospheric water cycle in the Tibetan Plateau and
Himalaya regions with a specific focus on organized convection and extreme precipitation. My aim is to improve
our understanding of the physical processes that lead to extreme precipitation, because this is a pre-requisite
to robustly assess future changes in the regional climate. I also try to bridge the gap between observational
and modeling perspectives, so I am working with both ground-based and space-borne observations as well as
numerical weather and climate models.
