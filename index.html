I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="http://rcg.gvc.gu.se/">Regional Climate Group</a> at the
<a href="https://www.gu.se/en/earth-sciences">Department for Earth Sciences</a>, <a href="https://www.gu.se/en">University of Gothenburg</a> (Sweden). I am doing climate research and with a Master's degree in Atmospheric Sciences, I am mainly interested in the question how a warmer
climate is changing <span style="font-weight:bold">atmospheric processes that control heavy rain and water availability</span>, because these parameters are essential for how we build our future societies. Read more about my specific research interests <a href="https://juliakukulies.github.io/research">here</a>.

While  my research focuses on the physical aspects of climate change, I am also interested in questions related to <span style="font-weight:bold">sustainability transitions and climate justice</span>. I am part of a <a href="https://gronamoment.se">collective blogg</a>, where me and my fellow bloggers write about topics from commonplace everyday life tips and concerns to reflections about the bigger questions of climate vulnerability and adaption (sorry, unfortunately only in Swedish).
