I received my Ph.D. degree and am currently working in the <a href="http://rcg.gvc.gu.se/">Regional Climate Group</a> at the
    <a href="https://www.gu.se/en/earth-sciences">Department for Earth Sciences</a>, <a href="https://www.gu.se/en">University of Gothenburg</a> (Sweden). I am doing climate research and with a Master's degree in Atmospheric Sciences, I am mainly interested in the <span style="font-weight:bold">role of atmospheric processes like water vapor transport, precipitation and storm formation in the Climate-Earth-System</span>. How these processes change in a warmer climate is an essential question for how we build our future societes, because they are directly related to water availability and natural hazards. Learn more about my specific research interests <a href="https://juliakukulies.github.io/research">here</a>.

    While  my research focuses on the physical aspects of the climate system and climate change, I am also interested in questions related to <span style="font-weight:bold">sustainability transitions and climate justice</span>. A dialogue between scientists, decision-makers and civil society is needed in many sustainability questions, whether on global, regional or local scale.
