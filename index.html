I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="http://rcg.gvc.gu.se/">Regional Climate Group</a> at the
<a href="https://www.gu.se/en/earth-sciences">Department for Earth Sciences</a>, <a href="https://www.gu.se/en">University of Gothenburg</a>.
With a Master's degree in Atmospheric Sciences, I am mainly interested in the question how a warmer
climate is changing atmospheric processes related to heavy rain and water availability, as these are essential
for how we build our future societies. Where can we live? Where can we grow food? What are the risks for
extreme events like flooding?

My PhD project is about past and future changes in the atmospheric water cycle in the Tibetan Plateau and
Himalaya region with a specific focus on organized convection and extreme precipitation. My aim is to improve
our understanding of the physical processes that lead to extreme precipitation, because this is a pre-requisite
to robustly assess future changes in the regional climate. I also try to bridge the gap between observational
and modeling perspectives, so I am working with both ground-based and space-borne observations as well as
numerical weather and climate models. Read more about my specific research interests here.
