I am a PhD candidate in the Regional Climate Group at the Department for Earth Sciences at the University of Gothenburg.
My PhD project is about past and future changes in the atmospheric water cycle in the Tibetan Plateau/ Himalaya region with a specific focus on organized convection and extreme precipitation. My aim is to improve our understanding of the physical processes that lead to extreme precipitation, because this is a prerequisite to robustly assess future changes in the regional climate.
