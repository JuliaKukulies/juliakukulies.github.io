I am a PhD candidate in the Regional Climate Group at the Department for Earth Sciences
at the University of Gothenburg. My PhD project is about past and future changes in the
atmospheric water cycle in the Tibetan Plateau/ Himalaya region with a specific focus on
organized convection and extreme precipitation. My aim is to improve our understanding of
the physical processes that lead to extreme precipitation, because this is a pre-requisite
to robustly assess future changes in the regional climate. I am also trying to bridge the
gap between observational and modeling perspectives and work with both ground-based and
space-borne observations as well as numerical weather and climate models.
