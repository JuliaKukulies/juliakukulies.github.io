I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="http://rcg.gvc.gu.se/">Regional Climate Group</a> at the
<a href="https://www.gu.se/en/earth-sciences">Department for Earth Sciences</a>, <a href="https://www.gu.se/en">University of Gothenburg</a> (Sweden). I am doing climate research and with a Master's degree in Atmospheric Sciences, I am mainly interested in the question how a warmer
climate is changing <span class="bolded">atmospheric processes that control heavy rain and water availability</span>, as these parameters are essential
for how we build our future societies. Where can we live? Where can we grow food? What are the risks for
extreme events like flooding?

My PhD project is about past and future changes in the atmospheric water cycle in the Tibetan Plateau and
    Himalaya region with a specific focus on organized convection and extreme precipitation. The Tibetan Plateau
    stores a lot of freshwater and is, likewise other mountain regions in the world, particularly vulnerable to climate change.
    My aim is to improve our understanding of the physical processes that lead to extreme precipitation in this particular region,
    because this is a pre-requisite to robustly assess future changes in the regional climate. I also try to bridge the gap between observational
and modeling perspectives, so I am working with both ground-based and space-borne observations as well as
    numerical weather and climate models. Read more about my specific research interests <a href="https://juliakukulies.github.io/research/">here</a>
