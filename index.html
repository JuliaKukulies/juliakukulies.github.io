I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="http://rcg.gvc.gu.se/">Regional Climate Group</a> at the
<a href="https://www.gu.se/en/earth-sciences">Department for Earth Sciences</a>, <a href="https://www.gu.se/en">University of Gothenburg</a> (Sweden). I am doing climate research and with a Master's degree in Atmospheric Sciences, I am mainly interested in the question how a warmer
climate is changing <span style="font-weight:bold">atmospheric processes that control heavy rain and water availability</span>, because these parameters are essential for how we build our future societies.

While  my research focuses on the physical aspects of climate change, I am also interested in questions related to <span style="font-weight:bold">sustainability transitions and climate justice</span>. I am part of a <a href="https://gronamoment.se">blogg collective</a> where me and my fellow bloggers write about these topics - from commonplace everyday life tips and concerns to reflections about the bigger questions of climate vulnerability and adaption(sorry, so far only in Swedish).
